<p> Hello, I'm Rian. I am currently an Industrial Engineering student at a university in Indonesia. I like the Python language and am interested in combining it with Industrial Engineering knowledge. Industrial engineering is concerned with how products or services are made from planning until it goes to consumers. Industrial engineering covers many things, ranging from production systems, supply chain and logistics, economic analysis, decision making, and others. Hopefully, this repository can motivate readers from industrial engineering or related fields. If I find interesting material, I will put it in this repository with python code.</p>

These are the source that I've already used:
1. Sarker and Newton - Optimization Modelling, A Practical Approach
2. Udemy - Supply Chain Design and Planning with Excel & Python. Haytham Omar, Consultant-Supply chain
3. Udemy - RA: Data Science and Supply Chain analytics. A-Z with Python. Haytham Omar, Consultant-Supply chain
4. Operations Management Sustainability and Supply Chain Management (12th Edition) by Jay Heizer, Barry Render, Chuck Munson 
5. DataCamp - Supply Chain Analytics in Python
